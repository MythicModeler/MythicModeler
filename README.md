Hi there, my name is Seth Heyer and I am newly entering into the Data Science Industry!

  		- ðŸ”­ I am currently enrolled in The Institution of Bloom Technology working on my Data Science degree. I am developing a strong foundation of skills in analyzing data in Python.
		- ðŸŒ± This year my family and I have started a farmers market stand, bought chickens and built a greenhouse. When I am not working I love to spend my time helping them.
		- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on books. My favorite genre is fantasy.
		- âš¡ Iâ€™m looking for connections in the data science industry to grow both my social connections and improve myself academically.
		- ðŸ˜„ Fun fact: Chickens are living decedents of dinosaurs.
		- ðŸ“« How to reach me: sheyer0597@gmail.com

		Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding! ðŸ˜„
